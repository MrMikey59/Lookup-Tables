Informational PEPs do not necessarily represent a Python community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PEPs or follow their advice. <br> - A Process PEP describes a process surrounding Python, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PEPs are like Standards Track PEPs but apply to areas other than the Python language itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Python's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational PEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them.

| Alpha level | The probability of making a Type 1 error--that is, wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis.

| Expected Monetary Value (EMV) | EMV is the weighted sum of possible payoffs for each alternative. The average value of a decision if it can be repeated many times.

Distributions are usually segregated into the categories of normal and nonnormal, continuous and discrete; The set of all possible values of a random variable and their associated probabilities. |  
| Random Number. | A number whose digits are selected completely at random.|  
| Random Number Interval | A range of random numbers assigned to represent a possible simulation outcome.|  
| Random variable | A rule that assigns a value to each possible outcome of an event. Alternatively, a sample randomly picked from a group that is judged to be representative of the group in some way.|  
| Risk Avoider | A person who avoids risk. On the utility curve, as the monetary value, the utility increases at a decreasing rate. This decision maker gets less utility for a greater risk and higher potential returns.|  
| Risk Seeker | A person who seeks risk. On the utility curve, as the monetary value increases, the utility increases at an increasing rate. This decision maker gets more pleasure for a greater risk and higher potential returns.|  
| Sequential Decisions | Decisions in which the outcome of one decision influences other decisions.|  
| Simulation | A quantitative analysis technique that involves building a mathematical model that represents a real-world situation. The model is then experimented with to estimate the effects of various actions and decisions.|  
| Simulation Modeling | models used to analyze a variety of complex and dynamic processes; often used when managers face a variety of possible outcomes with different probabilities; used in areas such as inventory modeling, production planning, budgeting, and many other areas to improve business decision making. |  
| Simulation Software Tools | Programming languages especially designed to be efficient in handling simulation problems.|  
| Skew | A term that describes data whose distribution plots more heavily in one direction. A tail leading to the right is a positive skew. A tail leading to the left is a negative skew. A symmetric distribution has no skew.|  
| Standard error | The standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample mean; that is, a measure of the error expected in the value obtained from any sample mean taken from a population. [equals the standard deviation divided by square root of the sample size]|  
| Standard Gamble | The process used to determine utility values.|  
| State of Nature | An outcome or occurrence over which the decision maker has little or no control.|  
| State-of-Nature Node | In a decision tree, a point where the EMV is computed. The branches coming from this node represent states of nature.|  
| Systems Simulation | Simulation models that deal with the dynamics of large organizational or governmental systems.|  
| T-Distribution | Infers whether a small sample accurately reflects a larger population by comparing degrees of freedom, the T-statistic, and associated values found on the T-Distribution Table.|  
| Utility | The overall value or worth of a particular outcome.|  
| Utility Assessment | The process of determining the utility of various outcomes. This is normally done using a standard gamble between any outcome for sure and a gamble between the worst and best outcomes.|  
| Utility Curve | A graph or curve that reveals the relationship between utility and monetary values. When this curve has been constructed, utility values from the curve can be used in the decision-making process.|  
| Utility Theory | A theory that allows decision makers to incorporate their risk preference and other factors into the decision-making process.|  
| Validation | The process of comparing a model to the real system that it represents to make sure that it is accurate.|  
| Verification | The process of determining that the computer model is internally consistent and following the logic of the conceptual model.|  
| Weibull distribution | A distribution that models the probable lifetimes of objects, such as the time until a given device will fail.|  


## Phrases
There is a phrase in French, “esprit d’escalier”, which literally means “stairway wit” and is used to refer to a witty remark a person thinks of too late to use in an encounter—a nod to how we often think of something great to say when we are taking the stairs to leave and it is too late to capitalize on our cleverness.  
English legal terms like “cease and desist” or “null and void” are redundant as a result of their translation from Latin legal terms to French (and onward from there).  
The phrases “no man is an island” and “for whom the bell tolls” are both from the same section in a set of devotions, Meditation XVII, by English metaphysical poet and cleric John Donne.  
In military lingo, a “klick” is shorthand for “kilometer”. Although the exact origin of the term is unknown, it is believed to have originated with Australian soldiers in Vietnam, who would use the gas regulator on their rifles to count off the distances they had hiked. They did so by moving it forward one mark for every 100 meters traveled, then reset it on the 10th interval, which resulted in an audible click for every kilometer hiked.  
American author Samuel Clemens’ pen name, Mark Twain, is actually a river boat term that means measure (mark) two (twain) fathoms deep.  
A pangram is a sentence that contains every character in a given language’s alphabet; the most famous English pangram, due to its prominence in early textbooks and in font samples today, is “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”.  
The claim that “orange” is the only word in the English language without a rhyme is false. There are hundreds of words without perfect rhymes including: bulb, filmed, ninth, and, rather ironically, poem.  
There are very few words in the English language that have a gender differentiation; the most prominent of them all is blond (a man with gold colored hair) and blonde (a woman with gold colored hair).  
"Voluntold" is exactly what it sounds like, an oxymoron combining volunteer and told. It is something one is asked to do voluntarily, but it has an unspoken understanding that it is not actually optional.  

### Ground Rules (from Baseball)
“Alright folks, let’s go over the ground rules…” is how just about every group activity starts out, be it a white water rafting trip or an afternoon playing laser tag. The “ground rules” are the basic rules for behavior, safety, and so on, for the given activity. While the term now means the basic rules, and has been used in that fashion since the 1950s, it was originally a literal term. The ground rules were the explicit rules for specific playing fields, or grounds, as they were called and the first known example of such use dates back to 1890.   
Despite the jump in the mid-20th century to general usage, the term is still in use with baseball fields, and per Major League Baseball regulations, individual stadiums have their own ground rules which are designed to take into account the design of the stadium. For example, one of the ground rules at Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, concerns the thick ivy on the outfield fence—if a ball becomes lodged in the ivy, two bases are awarded to the batter and all runners. If the ball falls out of the ivy after striking the fence, it remains in play.
